# Research Notes

+ Ben Goertzel
+ Other key players

+ Position on absence of addressing of Moore's Law
+ Or dump of knowledge

+ Trusting in Moore's Law, or something, to advance computing power towards AGI(???)

+ https://intelligence.org/2013/05/15/when-will-ai-be-created/ AI without relying on Moore's Law
    * Moore's law has seen hurdles before
    * "depletion of low hanging fruit"
    * Possible "space race"-esque moment


# Structure

+ Overview
    * What is the "singularity"
        - "asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply."
    * Exponential growth (with graph)
    * On-The-Cusp (with picture, from waitbutwhy)
+ Singularity deals with artificial intelligence, but what exactly is that
    * Background
        - Sci-fi robots with brains
            + The brain itself is the AI, not the physical robot
        - Any problem that couldn't previously be solved
            + And until we understand the solution
        - (I'm going to throw a lot of terms around here)
        - Search, rules, state    -spaces, etc.
        - Applications
            + Chess (DeepBlue), Jeopardy (Watson), reCaptcha (Google's Neural Network)
    * ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)
        - Weak AI
        - This encompasses *everything* we have so far
    * AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        - Strong AI
        - This is what we're working towards, and likely what will spark the singularity
    * ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)
        - No name for this
        - We humans feel pretty smart, but what all do we know?
        - This is the scary shit
+ Singularity
    * AGI is the "singularity", as it sparks the rapid growth towards ASI
    * But I'm here to argue that the *singularity* isn't as guaranteed as people make it out to be
+ Why we might not have the singularity as everyone envisions it
    * Since the beginning of AI research in 1950, we have always been optimistic about it being possible/achievable
        - Our proof of its possibility is humans, our brains are the standard
        - We have no proof of its achievability (given less than a billion years)
    * Many predictions about AGI's proximity are based off of past growth of computing power
        - Reasonable, as outlined in the earlier graph, maybe even an underestimate
        - However, exponential growth more often is actually bounded by a asymptote
            + Moore's Law cannot continue forever
                * Stated by Moore himself in 2005
            + There are stopgap measures, such as expanding the chip into 3D, that may see us through until the development of AGI, but it's not guaranteed
        - Without exponential growth in computing power, do we still have AGI?
            + That's not something I can know
                * Experts may not even know
+ Moore's Law
    * Number of transistors on a chip doubles every 24 months
        - Number of
