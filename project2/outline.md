+ Intro
    * Introduce:
        - AI
        - Singularity
        - Exponential Growth
        - Exp. Growth in computers
+ Artificial Intelligence
    * Tend to think of robots
        - This is only partially true, the robot is the container
    * In reality, AI encompasses tons of problems we don't understand (yet)
        - As soon as we do, no longer AI
    * Typical AI
        - Search, rules, states-spaces, etc.
    * Personal definition:
        - Algorithms that learn
    * Applications of AI today:
        - DeepBlue, Watson, breaking the reCaptcha
+ How AI leads into the Singularity
    * ANI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)
        - a.k.a. Weak AI
        - Encompasses all practical AI so far
    * AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)
        - a.k.a. Strong AI
        - This is what will likely spark the singularity
            + But more on that later
        - Being worked on *specifically*
            + By certain people
        - Experts agree that this isn't far away
            + Do any of them question Moore's Law
    * ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence)
        - AI that can do things that we can't
        - Ants are to humans as humans are to ASI
+ What is the Singularity (image)
    * The singularity refers to the cusp
    * "asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply."
    * General intelligence starts building itself better and better
        - In theory, jump from AGI to ASI is very quick
+ Moore's Law
    * Would come before AGI
    * "Number of transistors on a chip doubles every 24 months"
        - Self-fulfilling prophecy
            + R&D costs go up as well
    * Hurdles
        - Currently running into size and heat issues
        - However, have encountered these issues before, and overcome
            + Multi-core around 2005
            + 2006: Intel new "Super chips"
                * Probably i series
    * Moore's Law doesn't have to continue forever, just until AGI
    * ASI would find solution, **if** it exists
+ Progress (with squiggly exponential)
    * Progress happens, but not in the way we predict
    * Still no flying cars
    * Possibly no ASI or even AGI
    * But there will be progress
        - Possibly memristors, or quantum computing
+ Conclusion
    * ANI is pretty powerful
    * AGI is pretty awesome and a tipping point, but maybe not guaranteed
    * ASI is a scary thought
